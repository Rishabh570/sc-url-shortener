  npm run test
```

  
## Usage/Examples

### To get the short URL

```bash
$ curl -d '{"url": "<LONG-URL>"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' <BASE_URL>/shortenUrl
```

or, you can explicitly provide the TTL (time-to-live) for the short URL. By default, TTL is set to 2 years ahead.

```bash
$ curl -d '{"url": "<LONG-URL>", "ttl": "2020-12-25"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' <BASE_URL>/shortenUrl
```

Response:

```json
{
    "shortUrl":"<SHORT-URL>",
    "longUrl":"<LONG-URL>"
}
```

### To get the long URL

```bash
$ curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' <BASE_URL>/<SHORT-URL>
```

Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 OK

Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Location: <LONG-URL>
```
  
## FAQ

#### How a short key is generated?

It uses `nanoId` to generate a random string of predefined length.

#### How does it ensure the uniqueness of the key?

- `nanoId` doesn't ensure the uniqueness that's why there is an expiry date set at the time of short URL creation. A short key is open for reuse once the expiry date is hit.
- There are retries performed if it lands upon a non-expired short key during the random key generation process.
- Retries are capped and can be tweaked as per the requirement.

#### Does it support Analytics?

It uses Kafka to send events whenever a short URL is clicked. This gives the flexibility of plugging your own analytics service.
